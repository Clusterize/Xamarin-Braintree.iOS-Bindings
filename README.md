# Xamarin-Braintree.iOS-Bindings

A partially completed Xamarin.iOS bindings project for [Braintree v.zero SDK for iOS](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios).

Currently only a limited set of functionality is implemented, but that should be enough for a POC/spike integration of Braintree with Xamarin. As we need more features at [Clusterize](http://clusterize.co), I will be adding more complete bindings. Still, if you need something, drop me a PR or open an issue, and I'll be happy to merge/implement it sooner.
